# AudioSelector

AudioSelector is a [free](./LICENSE.md) menu bar application, helping with managing the audio interfaces of your Mac.

You can download the newest version in the **Release** section.

Note: An optimized version for macOS 11 (Big Sur) is in the making...

## Functionality

![AudioSelector Screenshot](./AudioSelector/Resources/Screenshot.png "AudioSelector Screenshot")

AudioSelector shows the complete list of all devices for audio in- and output, as well as for system output.
You can easily manage the audio levels using the sliders and select the active devices to be used.

Furthermore, you can select what your preferred devices are for in and output.
AudioSelector will make sure your preferred devices will stay selected when the hardware changes.
This comes in handy when a new device is added (e.g. monitor or bluetooth headphones are connected), as by default the macOS will try to switch to the newly connected device.

As an added bonus, you can pass the audio of the input device to the output device. This is useful if you want to listen to audio from another connected computer or instrument. A feature like this usually only comes with payed, specialised audio application.
